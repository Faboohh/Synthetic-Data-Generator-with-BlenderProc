## Introduction

BlenderProc is a synthetic data generator, it helps the process of training a neural network by reducing the amount of manual data collection required. This tool allows for easy modifications of data such as noise creation (new objects and different backgrounds).

### Pros
- Reduces manual data collection requirements
- Enables easy data variation and modification
- Accelerates neural network training processes
- Provides controlled testing environments

### Cons
- Performance degradation due to sim2real gap
- Does not replicate the real world, might be faulty
- Requires time and attention, steep learning curve

## Installation and Setup

### Environment Setup
To avoid conflicts and damage, create a dedicated conda environment:

Click here to follow the official Anaconda installation [guide](https://www.anaconda.com/download)

```bash
# Create new environment with Python 3.10
$ conda create --name blenderproc python=3.10

# Activate the environment
$ conda activate blenderproc

# To exit the environment (when needed)
$ conda deactivate

# Go inside your blenderproc folder inside the environment
cd your/path/to/env
